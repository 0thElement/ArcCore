-- Charts --
charts are imported as a series of files and a "spec.acspec" inside of a zip named 
"anything.arccorelevel"


-- Globals --
globals are marked with "globals." inside of the given .arccorelevel
globals can be namespaced as needed... "globals.floofer.my_image.jpg"

these globals are stored inside the "/globals" folder, along with "_rc.json",
which stores the amount of charts which reference the given global

when deleted, a chart will decrement the reference counts of all associated globals
